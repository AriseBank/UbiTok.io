# UbiTok.io
is an exchange for buying and selling Ethereum tokens and coins.

UbiTok.io runs entirely on the blockchain, which for clients means:
- no limits, no sign-up, no waiting for support to verify you;
- it cannot be shutdown by regulators - or even by its creators;
- you don't need to trust the exchange employees to look after your coins;
- no fees to pay (other than gas fees supporting the Ethereum blockchain).

We're also excited by the possibility of unleashing an ecosystem of smart contracts trading tokens with each other.

## How does UbiTok.io compare to other decentralised exchanges?
As far as we know, UbiTok.io is the first exchange to implement best execution of orders on-chain; most other decentralised exchanges either use an off-chain matching engine or require the user to select individual orders to match.

## Are there downsides to being 100% on-chain?
Yes - transaction times are much slower than a centralised exchange. This is hard to avoid - we need 1000s of Ethereum nodes worldwide to agree on the state of the orderbook (without trusting each other). You won't find High Frequency Traders on UbiTok.io - not necessarily a bad thing for everyone else! We've also had to reduce the number of price levels offered to allow us to perform best execution on-chain - so you'll see prices like 1.23, not 1.2298502.

## No fees? How do UbiTok.io make money?
To be confirmed. Email fundraising@ubitok.io if you'd like to hear about early investment opportunities.

## What's on the UbiTok.io roadmap?
- Host UbiTok.io front-end in Swarm/IPFS for total unstoppability;
- Nicer UI features (e.g. improved price charts);
- Reduced gas costs;
- Grow ecosystem of smart contracts that trade directly on-chain via UbiTok.io;

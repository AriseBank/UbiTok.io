# UbiTok.io
an unstoppable exchange for buying and selling Ethereum tokens and coins.

UbiTok.io runs entirely on the blockchain, which for clients means:
- no limits, no sign-up, no waiting for support to verify you;
- it cannot be shutdown by regulators - or even by its creators;
- you don't need to trust the exchange employees to look after your coins;
- no fees to pay (other than gas fees supporting the Ethereum blockchain);
- total fairness: no preferential treatment for "special" clients.

Our vision is to help unleash an ecosystem of smart contracts autonomously trading smart tokens.

## How does UbiTok.io compare to other decentralized exchanges?
As far as we know, UbiTok.io is the first decentralized exchange to meet ALL the following three tests:
 - our clients don't need to install any special P2P software;
 - we don't use an off-chain matching engine so we have no servers to shut down or be hacked;
 - we offer a ([full limit order book](docs/creating-orders.md)), giving clients the best possible price and the exchange features you expect.

## Who's behind UbiTok.io?
Our technologist has a background in algorithmic trading systems. He previously spent over a decade building secure, high volume gambling sites for leading bookmakers. He first dabbled in bitcoin in 2013 before flipping to Ethereum in 2016.

We're interested in growing our team in the near future - contact opportunities@ubitok.io.

## Are there downsides to being 100% on-chain?
Yes - transaction times are much slower than a centralised exchange. This is hard to avoid - we need 1000s of Ethereum nodes worldwide to agree on the state of the orderbook (without trusting each other). You won't find High Frequency Traders on UbiTok.io - not necessarily a bad thing for everyone else! We've also had to reduce the number of price levels offered to allow us to perform best execution on-chain - so you'll see prices like 1.23, not 1.2298502.

## No fees? How do UbiTok.io make money?
Rather than get into a race to the bottom on exchange fees, we will offer value-added products and services that build on top of our core exchange. Email fundraising@ubitok.io if you'd like to hear about early investment opportunities.

## What's on the UbiTok.io roadmap?
- Host UbiTok.io front-end in Swarm/IPFS for total unstoppability;
- Developer tools for creating smart contracts that trade via UbiTok.io - e.g. token sales, market makers;
- Improved (human) user interface;
- Margin trading / lending market-place;
- Help grow ecosystem of instruments to trade, such as futures or tokens backed by off-chain assets (e.g. bitcoin, USD);

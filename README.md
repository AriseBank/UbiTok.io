# UbiTok
an exchange for trading Ethereum tokens and coins

UbiTok runs *entirely* on the blockchain, which means:
- no limits
- no waiting for support to verify you
- no-one can shut it down (not even its creators)
- no need to trust anyone to look after your coins for you
- no fees (other than "gas" for the Ethereum blockchain)
